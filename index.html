<p>
    Hello to whoevers reading this my name is William and I am currently
    a sophomore studying Computer Science at ASU. I love to run and
    am currently training for my second marathon to hopefully
    qualify and run at the boston marathon soon. I am extremely driven
    and motivated, ready to take on whatever challenge life throws
    at me. Right now I want to get into the world of web development
    more so I decided to write this website to learn and talk about
    it.
